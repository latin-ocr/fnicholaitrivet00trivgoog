‘Fluminis impetus laetilicat civitatem Dn1,’ etc.
as a prelace, which may possibly he Trivet's.
The commentary of Valeys begins ‘In isto
primo contangit B. Augustinus duas culpas Ro-
manorum,’ etc.; whereas that of Trivet, which
we bave complete in the MS. Hor. 4093, begins,
‘Gloriosa dicte sunt de te, civitas Dur. Cum
Romani alia Gothorum irruptione affligeren-

ed. 1473, Valcys ends, ‘Tunc enim crat Por-
phyrius in rebus humanis‚' etc-‘suit enim ut
