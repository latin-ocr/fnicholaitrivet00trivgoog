Regum et Apostolorum* written in Norman-
French. These several works are, in fact, but
oue3 namely, the Annals which Trivet drew up
for the use of the Princess Mary, daughter os
Edward l., who became a nun in the convent
ol' Ameshury in 1285. The title of this work
is as follows, ‘ci comencent les Cronicles de

Frere Nichol Trivet, escrit a ma dame Marie,
la fillie mon Seigneur le Roi d’Engleterre, le
filtz Henri.’ ¹ It begins with Genesis, and con·
tains a brief chronology of lewish history, os
the Evangelists and Gestes of the Apostles, (i. o.
the Popes,) and is continued down to the time

of Edward I., and ‘lapostil Johan vincismie
secund.' This work was also written in Latin,
and dedicated to Hugh os Angoulcme, Arch-
deacon of Canterbury and Papal Nuncio, as
appears from a MS. then in the Sorbonne,
quoted hy the historiens ol the order of St.
Dominic 3² hut whether the Latin or the French
had the precedence in composition, we cannot
determine. There is, however, a presumption
in favour· of the Norman-French version, from
some expressions in tha dedication to the Prin·
cess Mary.
