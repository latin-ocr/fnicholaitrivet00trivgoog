for where he has occasion to extract froin other
authors, or to give insertion to state documents,
his truthsulness and accuracy are proved hythe
*sact that these, with the exception of an occa-

, sional clerical error, are often nearer to original
contemporary MSS. than those which appear in
the great collections of Wilkins or Rymer. His
style is smooth, clear, and agreeable; some-
times highly graphic in descrihing stirring in-
cidente, and osten not inelegant. Nor is this

mus, and the two Senecas

As an historiar, he rs always judicious, and 111· rhum
never violent In relating the misdeeds of Kingter nortl
John, both in his brother Richard's reign and 1n
his own, he is contented with stating the simple
facts as they occurred, in a straightforward
manner, abstaining from all vituperation; and
what is deserving os blame in Edward Ι. he
reproves with all frankuesS, plainly, as is this
monarch had uot' been his contemporary sove-
reign.

It is fitting, also, to rescue Trivet’s memory
srom the wholesale plagiarism of Walsingham,
whose Reign os Edward I. is taken, word lor

Meteorological Summary ol each year, which he
seems very often to have horrowed from the
Chroniclc of Dunstahle, andos occasional inter·
polations‚ which hear the evident stamp of a
much later age. For this reason Walsiugham
must be read with caution3 for though his inter-
polations in the portion he has appropriated
from Trivet are not many, aud comparatively
unimportant, it is not so iu succeeding reigns,
