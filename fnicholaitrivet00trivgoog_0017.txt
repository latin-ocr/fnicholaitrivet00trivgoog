large, and richly adorned; and, as a proos oi the
worth os the inmates of the convent, we have but
to repeat the eulogy of Leland, who says that

On Trivet's return srom Paris, he was ho-
nourably received by his brethren; but that he
was elected prior of his convent at London, we
baveno earlier authority than that oi the some-
what apocryphal Pnseus. We know, however,
sor certain, that he subsequently taught in the
schools at Oxlord, between which and his con·
vent at London was spent the remainder oi his
laborious and learned lise, divided between de-
votion and the composition oi many excellent
works3 which, is we except his Annals,² are
little known, and of which it is almost impossible
now to ascertain either the exact date or the
place os composition.

England os the house osAnjou embraces a period

‘¹⁰ ‘⁰' oi one hundred and seventy yearS, commencing

with the reign of Stephen in11.36‚and ending
somewhat abruptly at the death oi Edward Ι. in
1307. In composing his Annals, Trivet informs
ns that he had carelully made collectione, during
his residence in Paris, from the French chroni-
clers; and that, on contemporary events, he had
iaithsully endeavoured to obtain the best evi-
dence, lrom credible witnesses: an assertion
which is amply borne out by the narrative itself;
