is appended by Hall to his edition, and by him

intituled the Continuation of Trivet. This
name is very apt to mislead. The work treats,
indeed, ol the history os the successor ol Ed-
ward I.; hut its compiler, besides being known '
by others as the anonymous continuator os Mat-
thew ol Paris, is, in the style, arrangement, and,
we may add, quality, different from, and so in-
ferior to our author, that it has been judged
advisable to give the Annals ol Trivet entire,
and to reservo the other anonymous work sor
another occasion, when it may be more appro-
priately included among the numerous short,
and, in three instances, anonymous chroniclers
ol the reign ol Edward 11.

§a In conclusion, all that now remains forconeunon.
the Editor, is, the grateful task of alluding to
the advantagcs received by this edition in its
passing through the press oi Messrs. Bentley
and Co. To them he basto express his ohli-
gation3 but in a particular manner to the learn-

- ed person who superintends their reading depart-
ment. Few know what lahour and minuteness
are required where so many MSS. have been
consulted, and to this Gentleman the Editor is
indehted not only lor his patient industry and
acnteness, but also lor some valuahle readings
when it has been judged expedient to amend
the text.
